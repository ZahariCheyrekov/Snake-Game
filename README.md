Simple snake game using Java Swing

Today I decided to make a simple game using Java Swing. I learned a lot of things about Java Swing and face some difficulties too. 
I mean this is programming and it's not supposed to bea easy. The hardest thing was to make the game start over when you press enter or space bar, but without opening new window.
I decided to make the snake go from one side to another without hitting the frame bounds. That's why I speed up the snake a little more. Of course, 
I also added some stones to the game to make it harder. The goal is not to create a new number one game on Google Play or anything, but to make this simple Java snake game 
a fact and it happened. It's amazing! This is my first Java game and I'm happy about that. They are a lot of things which could be changed. For example, maybe add 
more stones to the game. Increasing the speed of the snake after eating certain amount of apples is definitely an option too. In the end of the day the most important 
thing is to have fun.

You can download the game too. I shared a jar file in this repository.
